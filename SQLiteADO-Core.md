### Database connectivity

The main classes in this group are LiteADO and LiteMan. ILiteADO has a place of its own: it is an interface class, which does not implement any functionality, but it enables the modular design of the library. Together with the supporting ADOlib class and a module with usage examples, these classes are located in the SQLite/ADO folder.

### LiteMan

From the calling code's perspective, LiteMan is the top-level API class. Shown in the blue rectangle, this database manager class serves to simplify common workflows, and so it is a convenience tool rather than an essential component. LiteMan is a predeclared class generating its instances via the Create factory. The factory is the default class member, taking a string describing the database (relative/full path or a designated shortcut name). The second optional argument controls whether a new database should be created and whether LiteFSCheck should use its path resolution protocol. The last optional argument accepts additional ODBC connection options. If no error occurs, LiteMan passes the resolved database descriptor to the LiteADO class, which generates the ILiteADO database object. LiteMan also provides routines for checking driver availability, attaching/detaching/cloning databases, placing the query result on an Excel worksheet, and controlling the journal type. When executed from the *immediate pane*, commands shown in the left table column below should produce output as indicated in the right column:

|                 Command                   |                Output                  |  
|-------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|  
| `?LiteMan.SQLite3ODBCDriverCheck()`       | **True**, if the ODBC driver is found. |  
| `?LiteMan(":mem:").ExecADO.GetScalar("")` | SQLite version number, e.g. **3.32.3** |  
| `?LiteMan(":tmp:").ExecADO.MainDB`        | Path to the new db in the Temp folder  |  
|                                           |                                        |  

Ideally, LiteMan should be primarily responsible for setup and teardown. From this point of view, it is overloaded and is a good candidate for refactoring.

### LiteADO

The top-level class of the package core is the LiteADO class, which is the only class that interacts with the ADODB library directly (note the green rectangles with ADODB objects in [Fig. 1](#SQLiteADO-Core) associated with LiteADO). It generates ILiteADO/LiteADO database objects and implements high-level methods for interacting with SQLite databases via the ADODB library and SQLiteODBC driver. The LiteADO's constructor instantiates a new ADODB.Command object and sets its ActiveConnection property to the connection string, thus, opening the database connection. Typically, it remains open for the lifetime of the ILiteADO/LiteADO object. The constructor also sets the default SQL query, which returns the SQLite version.

LiteADO also constructs the SQLiteODBC connection string passed to the ADODB library. LiteADO uses the LiteMan factory arguments described above for this purpose. The third argument, in particular, accepts extra ODBC connection options as either a formatted string or a dictionary. If the third argument is a string, it replaces the default options provided by LiteADO. When supplied in a dictionary, the extra options apply on top of defaults, overriding any matching values.

One important option, which is off by default and should be enabled, is foreign keys support. Two other noteworthy options are *Timeout* and *StepAPI*. Among other things, the *StepAPI* option may resolve undesirable timeouts due to a locked database and should probably be enabled by default. The SQLiteODBC driver has a bug: it ignores timeouts set via the ADODB objects. The only way to control the timeout duration is probably via this connection string option.

As mentioned earlier, this class is a feature-limited ADODB wrapper. Presently, it does not process events from the ADODB objects, handle parameterized queries (as opposed to SQLiteC), or handle ADODB errors.

### ILiteADO

ILiteADO formalizes LiteADO's interface, and it represents the main database-associated object. ILiteADO provides a unified high-level interface for interactions with SQLite databases, including opening/closing database connections, query execution methods, and transaction control. The two other groups of SQLiteADO classes take an ILiteADO object as a dependency. Originally a part of the SQLiteADO package, those classes can now be used by SQLiteC via its implementation of ILiteADO.

### ADOlib

ADOlib is a legacy module designed as a container for helper routines involving operations on ADODB objects. Presently, SQLiteCAdo uses only one method, RecordsetToQT, which outputs the contents of a Recordset onto an Excel worksheet via the QueryTable feature (see SQLiteIntropectionExample in 'SQLite/MetaSQL/Examples' for examples).
