### Major library components

I started this project as the [SQLiteDB VBA][] class, wrapping the ADODB library to facilitate introspection of the SQLite engine and databases. Later, I refactored the SQLiteDB class and several supporting class modules into the SQLiteADO subpackage shown on the left in [Fig. 1](#LibraryStructure). SQLiteADO incorporates a set of class modules with a shared prefix *Lite-*. Shown on the right, the other core subpackage SQLiteC uses SQLite C-API directly (and the *SQLiteC-* prefix).

The ILiteADO interface module shown in the center is a part of the SQLiteADO subpackage. It formalizes the high-level core functionality necessary for database interaction. As an OOP exercise, I implemented ILiteADO by the SQLiteC subpackage as well. An application may interact with SQLiteADO/SQLiteC directly via their APIs, which differ substantially. Or it may use the ILiteADO interface, which only exposes partial functionality but provides a unified API.

### Development environment

I use Excel 2002 (x32/VBA6) as my primary development environment. *SQLite C/ADO with Introspection for VBA* lives within the *SQLiteCAdoReflectVBAdev.xls* Excel Workbook located in the repository root. [Rubber Duck VBA][Rubber Duck VBA] VBA IDE add-in has become an essential VBA development component for me (and it installs just fine without the admin privileges on the user's account, which is a nice bonus). I also regularly use [RDVBA Project Utils][] for exporting/importing the virtual VBA project structure.

### Compatibility end testing

This project uses the RDVBA's unit testing framework as the primary means for testing, which means RDVBA addin is required to run the tests. As of this writing, I use RDVBA 2.5.2.5871 (I had some issues with the latest following release v2.5.2.1 / build 2.5.2.5906, as I do with the currently used version, but I am waiting for now for the next release). Testing-wise, this build has a known very annoying GUI-related issue, rendering the testing framework barely usable when the number of tests grows above, say, 100. As a workaround, I disable the display of tests with unknown and successful result statuses. Another RDVBA testing issue and a workaround are discussed in an [SO Q&amp;A][].

I run tests under x32/VBA6 (Excel XP/2002 SP3) and x64/VBA7 (Excel 2016) environments and might also include a small set of tests that will run without RDVBA. The project, therefore, should be compatible with both x32/VBA6 and x64/VBA7. The primary source of compatibility concerns is the declarations of API routines, and it boils down to three keywords: *PtrSafe*, *LongPtr*, and *LongLong*. To achieve portability, I use conditional compilation coupled primarily with the VBA7 constant. I have only a couple of instances of *LongLong*, and I added the WIN64 test within the VBA7 block for those cases, and I defined it as Currency within the VBA6 code. While not tested, this arrangement should make the code compatible with x32/VBA7, but it may not work under x64/VBA6.

### Required library references

* Microsoft ActiveX Data Objects 6.1 Library
* Microsoft Scripting Runtime 1.0
* Microsoft Visual Basic for Application Extensibility 5.3 (including approved programmatic access to the VBA project)
* Microsoft VBScript Regular Expressions 5.5
* Windows Script Host Object Model 1.0

While SQLiteCAdo does not access the VBA project, the third item is necessary for the [RDVBA Project Utils][] library (Common/Project Utils).

### VBA project structure

I assumed the following convention for structuring my project, as seen from the Code Explorer. First of all, in the root of the virtual directory structure, I have the *Common* directory for reusable components, such as *RDVBA Project Utils*. For example, I usually have these components placed in subfolders under *Common*:

* *CPearson/Array* contains the [Chip Pearson's Array library][CPearson Array] with some fixes,
* *Guard* contains the Guard component used for input validation and testing,
* *Project Utils* contains the *RDVBA Project Utils* package, and
* *Shared* contains several regular modules with various helper routines.

There are three other root-level directories in this project. The *SQLite* directory contains sufficiently mature components, which are the main focus of this project. *SQLiteDBdev* includes various experimental/draft modules. Finally, the *DllManager* directory contains the *DLL Manager* developed specifically for the SQLiteC subpackage, but it may be useful in other projects and is described later in this documentation.

I do not use the top-level directory *Tests*. Instead, I prefer having individual test modules as close to their targets as possible. In this relatively large project, I decided to make one exception. While I usually place test fixtures within test modules, in this case, it would mean a lot of duplicated code. Further, some of them are complex enough to justify tests of their own. For these reasons, I grouped test fixtures into several separate *Fix-* prefixed modules. To avoid global namespace pollution, I decided to use predeclared classes rather than standard modules. And because these modules serve the entire project, they essentially constitute a test fixtures subpackage. I added tests to this subpackage and placed it under the main project directory (*SQLite*).

### Repository structure

The main project file hosting this VBA project is the *SQLiteCAdoReflectVBAdev.xls* Excel Workbook located in the repository root. The repo also contains three directories. The *Project* directory contains all project code modules exported by running the *ProjectUtilsSnippets.ProjectFilesExport* macro from the *Common/Project Utils* virtual project folder. The *Assets* directory hosts documentation figures. Finally, the *Library* directory is for package-specific files.

Each package should host its files in a subdirectory under *Library*. This way, packages with all their supporting files can be added to other projects easily. For example, the *DllManager* subdirectory contains custom-build SQLite binaries (both x32 and x64). Several DLL Manager tests use these binaries as test fixtures. Similarly, *SQLiteCAdo* holds a demo database and various files used by tests, demos, and examples.

### Supporting tools

I prepare diagrams starting from the [yWorks yEd][] graph editor. I save originals in the native GraphML format and export them in the EPS format. Then I open EPS files in Adobe Illustrator CS6 and save them as SVGs (I also make jpg or png files at this point if necessary).

[TableGenerator][] assists with table markdown table creation.

[Grammarly][] service can significantly facilitate the writing process and help improve the linguistic quality of the texts.
