### VBA class managing loading DLL libraries

Before a DLL library placed in a user directory is available from the VBA code, it must be loaded via the Windows API (alternatively, the Declare statement may include the library location, but this approach is ugly and inconvenient). It is also prudent to unload the library when no longer needed. To make the load/unload process more robust, I created the DllManager class wrapping the LoadLibrary, FreeLibrary, and SetDllDirectory [APIs][DLL API]. DllManager can be used for loading/unloading multiple DLLs. It wraps a Scripting.Dictionary object to hold \<DLL name\>&nbsp;&rarr;&nbsp;\<DLL handle\> mapping.

**API**

*DllManager.Create* factory takes one optional parameter, indicating the user's DLL location, and passes it to *DllManager.Init* constructor. Ultimately, the *DefaultPath* setter (Property Let) handles this parameter. The setter checks if the parameter holds a valid absolute or a relative (w.r.t. ThisWorkbook.Path) path. If this check succeeds, SetDllDirectory API sets the default DLL search path. *DllManager.ResetDllSearchPath* can be used to reset the DLL search path to its default value.

*DllManager.Load* loads individual libraries. It takes the target library name and, optionally, path. If the target library has not been loaded, it attempts to resolve the DLL location by checking the provided value and the DefaultPath attribute. If resolution succeeds, the LoadLibrary API is called. *DllManager.Free*, in turn, unloads the previously loaded library.

*DllManager.LoadMultiple* loads a list of libraries. It takes a variable list of arguments (ParamArray) and loads them in the order provided. Alternatively, it also accepts a 0-based array of names as the sole argument. *DllManager.FreeMultiple* is the counterpart of *.LoadMultiple* with the same interface. If no arguments are provided, all loaded libraries are unloaded.

Finally, while *.Free/.FreeMultiple* can be called explicitly, *Class_Terminate* calls  *.FreeMultiple* and *.ResetDllSearchPath* automatically before the object is destroyed.

**Demo**

The *DllManagerDemo* example below illustrates how this class can be used and compares the usage patterns between system and user libraries. In this case, *WinSQLite3* system library is used as a reference (see *GetWinSQLite3VersionNumber*). A call to a custom compiled SQLite library placed in the project folder demos the additional code necessary to make such a call (see *GetSQLite3VersionNumber*). In both cases, *sqlite3_libversion_number* routine, returning the numeric library version, is declared and called.
