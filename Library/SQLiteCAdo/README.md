SQLiteDB VBA library is a set of VBA helper functions for the SQLite engine. The primary motivation behind this project is to provide convenient access to extended introspection features. Because of its generality, ADODB/ADOX libraries provide only limited metadata information. Furthermore, this information is only available if the underlying driver implements the relevant functionality. The *Introspection* subpackage of this library, on the other hand, relies on the generic SQL querying mechanism and specialized SQL queries. It facilitates access to complete information about both the features of the active engine used and objects/attributes of the attached database.
